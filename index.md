# About

I am a postgraduate student in [Health Economics and Policy](https://eu-hem.eu/) at the University of Oslo and the University of Bologna, fully funded by a fellowship from [Fundación Ramón Areces](https://www.fundacionareces.es/fundacionareces/en/). I also work as a RA at the University of Oxford under [Dr. Catia Nicodemo](https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/team/catia-nicodemo). Before that, I worked as a health economist at the [Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital](https://www.hospitalgermanstrias.cat/en) in Barcelona and as a public health trainee at the [WHO/PAHO](https://www.paho.org/en). In 2023 I graduated in [Philosophy, Politics & Economics](https://www.upf.edu/en/web/graus/grau-filosofia-politica-i-economia) at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid *et al.*

My research aims to answer questions regarding the value of interventions relative to public health --how can we reduce heart failure hospitalisations? What is the best way to treat COVID-19 sequelae?-- through quantitative measures related to health economics and general economic evaluation. In doing so, I employ various data-driven methodologies and leverage extensive datasets to analyze and extract valuable insights. In other words, I use data to figure out if certain actions or programs are worth it for public health.
