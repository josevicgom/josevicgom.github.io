I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [Universitat de Barcelona School of Economics](https://www.ub.edu/school-economics/), where I am supervised by [Prof. Judit Vall](https://www.juditvall.com/). I also serve as chief health economist at the Healthcare Strategy and Innovation Department of the [Germans Trias Hospital](https://www.germanstrias.org/en/). My research interests cover causal inference and health economics broadly defined, from applied microeconomic approaches in health, labour, and inequality to HTA and clinical trial design.

Previously, I have been a pre-doctoral research assistant at the University of Oxford under [Prof. Catia Nicodemo](https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/team/catia-nicodemo) and a public health specialist at the [WHO/PAHO](https://www.paho.org/en). You can download my CV [here](files/VicenteGomez_CV.pdf).
