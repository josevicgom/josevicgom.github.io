I am chief health economist at the [Germans Trias Hospital](https://www.germanstrias.org/en/) and PhD candidate in Economics at the [Universitat de Barcelona School of Economics](https://www.ub.edu/school-economics/), where I am supervised by [Prof. Judit Vall](https: //www.juditvall.com/). I have a broad interest in causal inference methods, HTA, and bringing the tools of microeconometrics to clinical research.

I also serve as a research fellow at [Future Policy Lab](https://www.futurepolicylab.com/nosotros/), a non-partisan evidence-driven think-tank that conducts research and advises institutions on public policy. Previously, I have been a pre-doctoral research assistant at the University of Oxford under [Prof. Catia Nicodemo](https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/team/catia-nicodemo) and a public health specialist at the [WHO/PAHO](https://www.paho.org/en).
