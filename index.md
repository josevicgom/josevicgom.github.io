I am Chief Health Economist at the Healthcare Innovation Department of the [Germans Trias Hospital](https://www.germanstrias.org/en/), where I lead the economic appraisal of health technologies and interventions using causal inference and experimental design. I am also a PhD candidate in Economics at the [Universitat de Barcelona School of Economics](https://www.ub.edu/school-economics/), where I am supervised by [Prof. Judit Vall](https://www.juditvall.com/). My research spans applied microeconomics of health, labor, and inequality, as well as impact evaluation in healthcare.

Previously, I have been a pre-doctoral research assistant at the University of Oxford under [Prof. Catia Nicodemo](https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/team/catia-nicodemo) and a public health specialist at the [WHO/PAHO](https://www.paho.org/en). You can download my CV [here](files/VicenteGomez_CV.pdf).
