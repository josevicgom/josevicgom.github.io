I am chief health economist at the [Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital](https://www.germanstrias.org/en/) and serve as a research fellow at the [Future Policy Lab](https://www.futurepolicylab.com/nosotros/) think-tank. I have a broad interest in causal inference, policy evaluation and bringing the tools of microeconometrics into clinical research.

In the past I have worked as a pre-doctoral research assistant at the University of Oxford under [Prof. Catia Nicodemo](https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/team/catia-nicodemo) and as a public health specialist at the [WHO/PAHO](https://www.paho.org/en). You can download my CV [here](files/cv.pdf).
