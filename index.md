# About

I am a postgraduate student in [European Health Economics](https://eu-hem.eu/) at Bologna University and Oslo University, fully funded by [Fundación Ramón Areces](https://www.fundacionareces.es/fundacionareces/en/). Previously, I worked as a health economicst at the [Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital](https://www.hospitalgermanstrias.cat/en) in Barcelona and as an intern at the [WHO/PAHO](https://www.paho.org/en). I am also a graduate in [Philosophy, Politics & Economics](https://www.upf.edu/en/web/graus/grau-filosofia-politica-i-economia) at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid et al.

My research aims to answer questions regarding the value of interventions relative to public health --how can we best treat heart failure patients? what is the most cost-effective way to treat COVID-19 sequelae?-- through quantitative measures related to health economics. In doing so, I employ various data-driven methodologies and leverage extensive datasets to analyze and extract valuable insights.
