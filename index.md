I am an applied economist with an interest in policy, health and labour. I work as a pre-doctoral research assistant at the University of Oxford under [Dr. Catia Nicodemo](https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/team/catia-nicodemo) and as a research fellow at [Future Policy Lab](https://www.futurepolicylab.com/nosotros/), a non-partisan evidence-driven think-tank led by young researchers. I am also a postgraduate student in [Health Economics and Policy](https://eu-hem.eu/) at the University of Oslo and the University of Bologna, fully funded by a scholarship from [Fundación Ramón Areces](https://www.fundacionareces.es/fundacionareces/en/).

Before that, I was a health economist at the [Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital](https://www.hospitalgermanstrias.cat/en) in Barcelona and a public health specialist at the [WHO/PAHO](https://www.paho.org/en). In 2023 I graduated in [Philosophy, Politics & Economics](https://www.upf.edu/en/web/graus/grau-filosofia-politica-i-economia) at Universitat Pompeu Fabra and Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. You can download my CV [here](files/cv.pdf).

I have a broad interest in health and labour economics, where I employ various data-driven methodologies and leverage extensive datasets to analyze and extract valuable insights.

I am also a first-generation college graduate, and in my free time I do powerlifting and enjoy reading economic history and political theory, among other things.
