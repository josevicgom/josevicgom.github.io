I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [Universitat de Barcelona School of Economics](https://www.ub.edu/school-economics/), where I am supervised by [Prof. Judit Vall](https://www.juditvall.com/). I am also Head of Health Economics at the Healthcare Innovation Directorate of the [Germans Trias Hospital](https://www.germanstrias.org/en/), where I lead the economic appraisal of policies using experimental designs and causal inference.

Previously, I was a pre-doctoral research assistant at the University of Oxford under [Prof. Catia Nicodemo](https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/team/catia-nicodemo) and a [Ramón Areces Foundation Postgraduate Fellow](https://www.fundacionareces.es/fundacionareces/en/), and before that, a public health specialist at the [WHO/PAHO](https://www.paho.org/en).
